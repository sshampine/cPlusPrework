# Arithmetic Expressions

The original Python homework was to reinfoce variable assignment and arithmetic expressions by caluclating annual salary if paid every two weeks and bi-weekly.

### Original Assignment

> Arithmetic Expressions

> A particular employee earns $32,500 annually. Write a program that determines and displays the amount of 
> is/her gross pay for each pay period, if he/she is paid twice a month (24 pay checks per year) and if he 
> is paid bi-weekly (26 check per year).

> Turn in the following:

> 1. A hardcopy of your source code
> 2. A hard copy of your output

## What I Learned

* Must specifiy variable types
* I did not specify `using namespace std` in my .cpp file
  * `using namespace std` seems to be ok to use in a .cpp file but NOT in a header file
