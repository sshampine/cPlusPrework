# Arithmetic Expressions

The original Python homework was to reinforce variable assignment and arithmetic expressions by calculating the average of five test grades.

### Original Assignment

> Arithmetic Expressions

> Write a program that gets five test scores from the user, calculates their average, and prints it on 
> the screen. Test your program with the following data:
> Run 1: 40, 80, 97, 32, 87 Run 2: 60, 90, 100, 99, 95

> Turn in the following:

> 1. A hardcopy of your source code
> 2. A hard copy of your output

## What I Learned

* Must specifiy variable types
* This time I specified `using namespace std` in my .cpp file
