# Decision Structures

A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are given according to the following table.

|Quantity | Discount
|---	  | ---
| 10 - 19 | 20% 
| 20 - 49 | 30%
| 50 - 69 | 35%
| 70 â€“ 99 | 40%
| 100 or more | 50%

Write a program that asks for the number of units sold and computes the total cost of the purchase and the savings due to the discount applied. The program should also display the number of units purchased and the discount in percentage. The output should include the following text:

### Output

```Number of units purchased is: 
Discount applied is: Total savings due to discount is: 
The total cost of the purchase is:
```

Do NOT use a logical operator in the program.

Run your program three times with 5, 59, and 110 as the user input for the number of units purchased.
Turn in the following:

1. A hardcopy of your source code
2. A hardcopy of your output
