# Arithmetic Expressions

The original Python homework was to calculate property taxes based on the assessed value of the property.

### Original Assignment

> A county collects property taxes on the assessed value of property, which is 60 percent of its actual value. For example, if a house is valued at $158,000.00 its assessed value is $94,800. This is the amount the homeowner pays tax on. If the tax rate is $2.64 for each $100.00 of assessed value, the annual property tax for this house would be $2502.72. Write a program that asks the user for the actual value of a piece of property and the current tax rate for each $100.00 of assessed value. The program should then calculate and display how much annual property tax the homeowner will be charged for his property.

> Run your program three times with $100,000.00, $200,000.00, and $350,000.00, as the user input for the value of the property and a tax rate of $2.05 for each $100.00 of the assessed value.
Turn in the following:

> 1. A hardcopy of your source code (Program3.py)
> 2. A hardcopy of your output

## What I Learned

* Must specifiy variable types
* This time I specified `using namespace std` in my .cpp file
