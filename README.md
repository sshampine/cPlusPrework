# C++ Prework

My goal for this repo is to help prepare me for my upcoming C++ credit course. I'm in the process of finishing up my degree in computer science and C++ is next on the list. Python was my intro to computer science. My goal is to convert my Python homeworks into C++ using the lessons from [LearnCpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com).

## Tools

* Old Python Code
* Dev C++ IDE
* Micorosft VS Code
* [LearnCpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com)
